## Why

We created a nice simple data grid for general use in or applications.  We want to add a search feature to the grid so users can look for specific records in their data table. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/SimpleGridWithSearch
   cd SimpleGridWithSearch
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. UI component, search box
2. Does a full search on the records in the data collection
3. Updates the UI with the search results
4. Applies a "Clear" button to return to the full record set
5. As a bonus, we added support for hitting enter on the input and executing the search
